#' @param Markov_trace_ Numeric matrix representing the Markov trace of the
#' model.
#' @param utilities_ Numeric vector defining the utilities associated with each
#' state in a Markov model.
#' @param discounting_weights_ Numeric vector containing the discounting weights
#' associated with each cycle.

#' @return A numeric vector containing the QALYs accrued over a Markov model
#' time horizon, for each state.
