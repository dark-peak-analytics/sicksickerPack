#' Calculate Discounting Weights
#'
#' @description Calculate the discounting weights that correspond to a defined
#' model time-horizon. Discounting could be employed starting from the initial
#' cycle.
#'
#' @param discount_rate_ Numeric, the rate used to estimate the discounting
#' weights.
#' @param time_horizon_ Numeric, time horizon, number of cycles for which the
#' discounting weights are to be calculated.
#' @param first_cycle_ Logical, for whether to start discounting from the first
#' cycle. Default is FALSE, where the discounting weight corresponding to the
#' first cycle is equal to one.
#'
#' @return A numeric vector containing the discounting weights.
